I am a graduate student in Finance and Business Economics at USC interested in empirical asset pricing, financial risk, and dividend processes. I am currently working on projects examining price-ratios of individual stocks instead of returns, as well as . [In my most recent working paper][1], I find that price-ratios of individual firms do not appear well defined by return and dividend expectations, and instead are better explained by financial market frictions and an often ignored constant resulting from the Taylor approximation.
