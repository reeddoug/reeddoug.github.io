# Where do Price-Ratios Vary?

In my most recent working paper, [The Cross-Sectional Variation of Stock Prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3759410), I examine price-ratios instead of returns. Price-ratios are significantly different from returns, and tend to vary significantly more in the cross-section than they do in the time series. In the working paper, I decompose the variation in price-ratios (specifically, Price-to-Net Payouts (P/D) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E)), and I find that between 94% and 96% of the total variation in price-ratios lies in the Fama-MacBeth style cross-section. The rest of the variation lives in the time-series.


|  | P/D | P/E |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| TS Mean of XS Var   | 96%   | 94%   |
| TS Var of XS Mean   | 4%   | 6%   |

This is interesting. While most studies turn immediately to examining returns in the time-series, price-ratios remain relatively less explored, and assuming they vary like returns in the time-series would imply that researchers are missing the vast majority of variation.
