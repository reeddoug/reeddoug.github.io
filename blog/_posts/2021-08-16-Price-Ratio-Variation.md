# Where do Price-Ratios Vary?

In my most recent working paper, [The Cross-Sectional Variation of Stock Prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3759410), I examine individual stock price-ratios instead of returns. Price-ratios are meaningfully different from returns, and tend to vary significantly more in the cross-section than they do in the time series. I decompose the variation in price ratios (specifically, Price-to-Net Payouts (P/D) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E)), and I find that between 94% and 96% of the total variation in price-ratios lies in the Fama-MacBeth style cross-section. The small amount of remaining variation lives in the time-series.

|                       |   P/D   |   P/E   |
|:----------------------|:-------:|:-------:|
| TS Mean of XS Var     |   96%   |   94%   |
| TS Var of XS Mean     |    4%   |    6%   |

It seems that when considering price-ratios, the Fama-MacBeth cross-section is the natural place to look for variation.
