I am a graduate student in Finance at USC, and I am interested in empirical asset pricing, financial risk, and investor return and dividend expectations. I am currently working on projects that use the price-ratios of individual stocks as on the left-hand side dependent variable instead of returns. [My working paper examining prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3759410) finds that price-ratios of individual firms do not appear well defined by return and dividend expectations. Instead, a surprising amount of price-ratio variation between firms -- ratios which theory dictates should be fully explained by return and dividend expectations -- are actually explained by financial market frictions.

## Research
[Linear-Betas in the Cross-Section of Returns](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3522641)
> This paper evaluates a specification for conditional beta models following Fama and French (2020). In this paper, I reject the Fama and French model that assumes characteristics are conditional betas in favor of a linear conditional beta model following Shanken (1990). Model-implied zero-beta rates are particularly sensitive to the specification, and the linear conditional beta model provides a significantly lower rate. Out-of-sample tests show that the Linear-Beta Model has a significantly lower bias and Clark and West (2007) adjusted MSPE, but it may come at the cost of a larger variance than the Fama and French model.



[The Cross-Sectional Variation of Stock Prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3759410)
> In this paper, I decompose prices over a set of 21 variables across seven categories. I test a firm-specific version of the Campbell and Shiller (1988b) model against these categories and show expected returns and change in cash-flows explain 5% or less of modeled price variation while an often-ignored time-series constant explains over 70%. Approximately 50% to 70% of modeled cross-sectional variation is explained by efficient market variables, with the remainder explained by market frictions. I find institutional ownership and share repurchases show a significant ability in the cross-section to explain next-period prices, while transaction costs and some traditional market risk-factors fail to translate well to a price setting.
